Tutorial Setup Guidelines
=========================

The phrases 'tutorial,' 'project,' and 'repo' will be used somewhat interchangeably.
They all refer to the same idea: the collection of data that constitutes an ATLAS node of information.

Structure
---------

All C/C++ tutorials should be set up to work with CMake.  It should have the
following directory structure:

RepoRoot/
|---[- header/]
|		# optional
|		# Contains all header files (.h, .hpp, .inl)
|---[- lib/]
|		# optional
|		# Contains all libraries used, zipped. To be extracted by CMake
|---[- shaders/]
|		# optional
|		# Contains all shaders (.glsl, .vs, .fs)
|---- source/
|		# Required, even if all you have is main.cpp
|		# Contains all source files (.c, .cpp)
|---- .gitignore
|		# Only needs the statement `build'
|		# See .gitignore included in this repo
|---- CMakeLists.txt
|		# Every tutorial will have a slightly different CMakeLists.txt, but most should be akin to the included file in this repo
|			# The included CMakeLists.txt example shows how to include GLFW, GLEW, and GLM in an OpenGL project
|		# In essense, nothing should be copied except unzipping libraries and copying .dll files
|		# In particular source files should not be copied
|---- LICENSE
|		# All tutorials will be licensed under GPL-3.0
|		# See LICENSE file in this repo
|---- README.md
|		# Every Readme will be slightly different, but most should be akin to README_BASE.md in this repo
|---- igme_config.yml
|		# Every igme_config.yml will have the structure defined in igme_config_base.yml
|		# Use igme_config_config.sh to setup this file (needs to be run in *nix-like env [if you have git bash, that'll do])
|			# DO NOT INCLUDE igme_config_config.sh IN THE REPO
|---- igme_thumbnail.png
|		# A simple image of the tutorial running (even if all it does is print to the console!)
|		# See an example in this repo
|---- setup
|		# Setup for OS X and Linux systems
|		# See included files
`---- setup.cmd
		# Setup for Windows systems
		# See included files

If a tutorial has nothing but links (a highly undesirable, but possible situation), then the directory structure is
RepoRoot/
|---- LICENSE
|---- README.md
`---- igme_config.yml

No other files are necessary.

Included tools
--------------
igme_config_base.yml
- The base file for igme_config.yml
- Setup to work with igme_config_config.sh
- See documentation for full parameter list

igme_config_config.sh
- Usage: ./igme_config_config.sh ConfigFile [Series] [Project] [Author] [AuthorGithub] [Description] [Language]
- Automatically names the series, project, author.name, author.github, description, and language parameters in ConfigFile,
	which should be a copy of igme_config_base.yml

igme_project_convert.sh
- Converts a Visual Studio Project to a CMake project
- Every VS project is a little different, so this will require customization and tweaking on your part.
- Tested on Visual Studio 15

igme_prepend_header.sh
- Usage: ./igme_prepend_header.sh FileToPrependTo [ProjectName] [AuthorName]
- Prepends the license header for ATLAS developers under David Schwartz to a source file
